                <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
                <p>The Health Literacy Program at Camino Health addresses health disparities, particularly among immigrants who face barriers in navigating the healthcare system due to language, education, and resource gaps. Having witnessed these challenges, we believe that the lack of healthcare support for immigrants is both a public health and political issue, perpetuating systematic inequities.</p>
                <p>The program builds on Camino Health's social navigation, employment readiness, and ESL services to equip individuals with the knowledge and tools to make informed health decisions. By improving health literacy, the initiative seeks to enhance health outcomes and create stronger, more resilient communities with equitable healthcare.</p>
