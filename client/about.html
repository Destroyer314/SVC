                <h2>Imagine this</h2>
                    <p>You sit in the cold, sterile exam room. The doctor rushes in, flipping through a chart. He barely looks at you before speaking.
                        "Your CBC shows elevated WBCs. Could be an AE of the Rx, but we need an MRI to r/o something more serious. Also, your BP is still high, so I’m increasing your Lisinopril to 20mg qd. Cut Na+, watch for ADRs—dizziness, syncope, angioedema. Call if you have dyspnea. We’ll do a CMP in 3 months to check renal function. Got it?"
                        He scribbles something on a paper and hands it to you. You stare at the letters. They blur together.
                        "Take this to the pharmacy," he says, already halfway out the door.
                        The paper reads:
                        Take 1 tab PO QD. PRN for sx. Avoid ETOH. May cause drowsiness. Do not D/C abruptly.
                        You don’t understand. Do you take it once a day? Twice? What happens if you forget? What does “D/C” mean? Will it hurt you? The pharmacist hands you a bottle with more words you don’t know. No one explains.
                        The fear sits in your chest. You don't know what’s wrong with you. You don't know what to do next.
                        And no one notices.

                <p>In our 2-5 year strategic plan, we aim to expand this initiative across the UNC system, beginning with UNC Chapel Hill's MERA program which assists Arabic-speaking refugees. This expansion will create a network of health literacy programs across North Carolina's universities, maximizing our impact on diverse communities.</p>

                <h2>Project Development</h2>
                <p>This project was developed as part of the World MUN program at UNC Charlotte. Sofia Fuentes created this social venture concept to address the critical need for better health literacy among immigrant populations in Charlotte.</p>
                <p>The venture is designed to be sustainable, scalable, and have measurable impact on the communities it serves. By leveraging university resources and student volunteers, the program creates a win-win situation where students gain valuable experience while providing essential services to underserved communities.</p>
