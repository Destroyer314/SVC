                <h2>Program Overview</h2>
                <p>Our social venture aims to tackle the issue of health illiteracy, particularly among Hispanic/Latino populations, by developing a student-led initiative that bridges communication gaps in healthcare settings. The core of our model is a culturally competent, bilingual peer education and advocacy program that trains university students to serve as health literacy navigators for their communities.</p>
                <p>Our solution stands out due to its sustainability, scalability, and community-centered approach. By leveraging university students — many of whom have firsthand experience with language barriers and health literacy challenges — we create a network of informed advocates who can provide culturally competent support to those in need.</p>
