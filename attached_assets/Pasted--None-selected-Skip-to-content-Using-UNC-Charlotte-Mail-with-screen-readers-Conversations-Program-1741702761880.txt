Short description of proposed venture
The Health Literacy Program at Camino Health aims to empower
underserved communities by providing accessible, multilingual
education on navigating healthcare systems, understanding medical
information, and making informed decisions. Through workshops,
digital resources, and one-on-one guidance, the program addresses
barriers in health communication, improving patient outcomes and
overall community well-being.
What is the inspiration for the proposed social venture?
The proposed Health Literacy Program at Camino Health addresses
health disparities, particularly among immigrants who face barriers in
navigating the healthcare system due to language, education, and
resource gaps. Having witnessed these challenges, I believe that the
lack of healthcare support for immigrants is both a public health and
political issue, perpetuating systematic inequities. The program builds
on Camino Health's social navigation, employment readiness, and ESL
services to equip individuals with the knowledge and tools to make
informed health decisions. By improving health literacy the initiative
seeks to enhance health outcomes and create stronger, more resilient
communities with equitable healthcare.

Charlotte’s immigrant population faces considerable challenges in
accessing and understanding healthcare services due to language
barriers, limited health literacy, and a lack of patient advocacy
training. While there is a strong network of support for English
language learners in the area, these programs do not specically
focus on health-related terminology or skills that are critical in
navigating the healthcare system. The inability to communicate
efectively with healthcare providers, comprehend medication
instructions, or understand medical diagnoses can have severe
consequences for non-English speakers.
For many immigrants, the language barrier extends beyond basic
communication; it directly impacts their health. When individuals
cannot e
ectively express symptoms, ask questions, or understand
instructions, it can lead to missed diagnoses, medication errors, and
inadequate follow-up care. Furthermore, many immigrant populations
face cultural di

erences that complicate their understanding of
healthcare practices and patient rights in the U.S. Without a
comprehensive understanding of how to navigate healthcare systems
or advocate for their needs, patients may feel overwhelmed and
marginalized, resulting in poor health outcomes.
Additionally, health literacy is closely linked to overall community
health, and a lack of understanding of medical terms can prevent
individuals from making informed decisions about their care. For
example, without a proper understanding of prescription instructions,
patients may misuse medications, leading to unnecessary
complications. Furthermore, the complexity of insurance systems,
appointment scheduling, and understanding medical bills can prevent
non-English speakers from seeking necessary care or following
through with treatments.
This lack of healthcare literacy exacerbates existing health disparities
and contributes to a cycle of poor health within immigrant
communities. In Charlotte, the absence of language programs that
focus specically on health terminology and patient advocacy skills
leaves these vulnerable populations underserved. To address this
issue, there is a critical need for targeted health literacy programs that
empower immigrants with the knowledge and resources to effectively
navigate the healthcare system, ensuring better health outcomes and
reducing systemic inequities.
How will your social venture address the problem you have
identifed?
The proposed Health Literacy Program at Camino Health will directly
address the problem of inadequate health literacy in immigrant
communities by providing targeted education on healthcare
terminology, patient advocacy, and system navigation. This program
will focus on equipping non-English speakers with the skills needed to
communicate efectively with healthcare providers, understand
medical instructions, and make informed decisions about their health.
The program will offer multilingual workshops that cover essential

health topics, such as understanding prescriptions, appointment
scheduling, and insurance processes, while also teaching participants
how to ask critical questions and advocate for their own healthcare
needs. Additionally, the program will incorporate culturally sensitive
content to ensure that it resonates with the diverse backgrounds of
participants, helping them navigate the U.S. healthcare system in a
way that aligns with their values and experiences.
By building these health literacy skills, the program will reduce the
barriers to healthcare access that immigrants face, improving their
ability to seek timely care, follow treatment plans, and manage
chronic conditions. Furthermore, it will empower individuals to
confidently advocate for their health, fostering greater trust in
healthcare providers and reducing the systemic inequities that
contribute to health disparities.
Ultimately, this initiative will strengthen the community by enhancing
overall health outcomes, reducing the likelihood of medical errors,
and promoting healthier, more informed families. By addressing the
specifc health literacy needs of immigrant populations, the program
will create a more equitable healthcare environment in Charlotte,
where all residents can access the care they need with confidence and

understanding.
What social impact(s) will your social venture have?
The Health Literacy Program at Camino Health will have tangible social
impacts on Charlotte’s immigrant communities. By teaching essential
healthcare terms, communication skills, and system navigation, the
program will result in fewer missed diagnoses, improved medication
adherence, and better chronic disease management.
The program will directly increase healthcare access by helping
immigrants communicate with providers, understand prescriptions,
and navigate insurance systems, leading to more timely care and
fewer avoidable emergency room visits. This will reduce the
financial burden on the healthcare system, as better health management
reduces the number of uninsured patients who rely on costly
emergency services.
Additionally, it will reduce health disparities by ensuring that
immigrant families have the tools to advocate for their healthcare
needs. By building confidence in healthcare interactions, the program
will foster self-advocacy, leading to better health outcomes, and
contributing to a more equitable healthcare system in Charlotte.

What is your social venture's mission statement?
The mission of the Health Literacy Program is to empower immigrant
communities in the Charlotte area and beyond by providing culturally
relevant, accessible, and comprehensive education that enables
individuals to navigate the healthcare system effectively, understand

medical terminology, and advocate for their health. Through this

program, we aim to bridge the gap in healthcare access for non-
English speaking populations, a group that often faces unique barriers

in communicating their health needs, comprehending medical
instructions, and understanding their rights as patients. Our mission is
grounded in the belief that language should never be a barrier to
receiving quality healthcare.
At its core, the Health Literacy Program focuses on integrating health
literacy into existing educational programs for English language
learners, providing them with essential healthcare knowledge,
including understanding prescriptions, medical terminology, and basic
healthcare procedures. We aim to equip immigrants with the skills
needed to communicate their symptoms accurately, understand the
instructions given by healthcare providers, and make informed
decisions about their care. By integrating health literacy into English as
a Second Language (ESL) curricula, we ensure that our participants
develop the specific communication skills necessary for navigating

healthcare settings.
The immediate goal of our program is to work closely with Camino
Health, a bilingual clinic serving the greater Charlotte area, to
implement a curriculum provided by the National Institute of Health.
By using proven health literacy materials, we will train volunteer
educators and healthcare professionals to teach the curriculum to
immigrant populations. These individuals will receive the support
needed to understand their health better, advocate for themselves,
and ultimately improve their health outcomes. Additionally, we plan to
recruit volunteers from the UNC Charlotte community, offering them
opportunities to make a tangible difference in the lives of immigrants
by providing hands-on support in the classroom and healthcare
settings.
One of our long-term goals is to extend the Health Literacy Program to
other universities within the University of North Carolina system,

starting with Chapel Hill and its MERA program, which assists Arabic-
speaking refugees. By working with these universities, we aim to

create a culture of positivity, advocacy, and support for immigrant
communities across campuses. We envision a future where all UNC
campuses are equipped with health literacy programs that can serve
their local communities, fostering a broader sense of community
engagement and social responsibility among students.
In sum, the Health Literacy Program seeks to address a critical gap in
healthcare access for immigrant populations. By providing health
literacy education, we will improve the ability of non-English speakers
to navigate the healthcare system, reduce health disparities, and
empower individuals to advocate for their health. Through sustainable
partnerships, dedicated volunteers, and university involvement, we
aim to create lasting, positive change in the communities we serve
and beyond.

Expand on your previous description of how your social venture
will address the issue you have identified. Please address the
strengths and unique aspects of the proposed solution. Please be
specifc in describing the model you are proposing and how it will
work.
Our social venture aims to tackle the issue of health illiteracy,
particularly among Hispanic/Latino populations, by developing a
student-led initiative that bridges communication gaps in healthcare
settings. The core of our model is a culturally competent, bilingual
peer education and advocacy program that trains university students
to serve as health literacy navigators for their communities. Given the
success of our initial model, we are now expanding to other university
campuses to broaden our impact and ensure that more communities
benefit from accessible health information and support.
Our solution stands out due to its sustainability, scalability, and
community-centered approach. By leveraging university students;
many of whom have
firsthand experience with language barriers and
health literacy challenges; we create a network of informed advocates
who can provide culturally competent support to those in need. This
model is particularly effective because it draws from the lived
experiences of participants, ensuring that the assistance provided is
both empathetic and practical.
Another key strength of our model is its interdisciplinary nature.
Students from various
fields, including public health, social work,
political science, and pre-med, collaborate to address different
dimensions of health literacy. This diversity fosters comprehensive
solutions that consider policy implications, medical accuracy, and
effective communication strategies.
Additionally, our initiative partners with local clinics, and community
centers. The integration of technology, including an online resource
hub and mobile application, further enhances accessibility for
individuals who may not have access to in-person support.
The venture operates through a structured three-tier model:
Training and Certifcation: University students undergo a rigorous
training program that covers health literacy fundamentals, medical
terminology, interpretation ethics, and effective communication skills.

This certifcation ensures that students are well-equipped to assist

individuals navigating the healthcare system.
Community Engagement and Direct Assistance: Certifid students
volunteer in hospitals, community health centers, and legal clinics to
provide real-time interpretation, assist with
filling out medical
paperwork, and educate families on their healthcare rights and
available resources.
Policy Advocacy and Expansion: A leadership team, composed of
experienced members, works on expanding the program to other
university campuses by forging partnerships with faculty, student
organizations, and healthcare providers. They also advocate for
institutional policies that improve healthcare accessibility for non-

English-speaking populations.
Recognizing the widespread nature of health illiteracy, we are scaling
this model by establishing chapters at additional universities. Each
new campus chapter will follow a standardized implementation
framework, which includes faculty sponsorship, community
partnership development, and recruitment of bilingual student
volunteers. By creating an inter-university network, we foster
knowledge-sharing, improve program effectiveness, and amplify our

advocacy efforts on a national scale.

Our social venture presents a unique and scalable solution to health
illiteracy, particularly among Hispanic/Latino populations. By
empowering bilingual university students to serve as health literacy
navigators, we bridge communication gaps, enhance healthcare
accessibility, and create a sustainable impact that extends beyond
individual communities. Through our expansion efforts, we aim to
institutionalize health literacy support on campuses nationwide,
ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the assistance they need
to navigate complex healthcare systems effectively.
What other organizations, programs, or businesses are
addressing the same problem your social venture intends to
address? How is your social venture unique? What opportunities
are there for collaboration or partnership?
Our social venture initially focuses on addressing health illiteracy
within Spanish-speaking communities, recognizing the signifcant
need for culturally competent and language-accessible healthcare
resources. By training bilingual university students as health literacy
navigators, we ensure that Spanish-speaking individuals receive
assistance in navigating medical paperwork, understanding health
information, and accessing appropriate care. As we expand, we aim to
adapt our model to meet the unique health literacy needs of each
university and its surrounding community.
For example, by expanding to UNC Chapel Hill, we can support their
existing health literacy initiatives while tailoring our program to the
specifc demographics and challenges they face. This

flexibility allows
us to build a sustainable and impactful program that serves diverse
populations beyond Spanish speakers, such as refugee communities,
individuals with limited English proffciency, and those needing

accessible health information due to disabilities.
Several organizations, programs, and businesses are working to
address health illiteracy, particularly among Hispanic/Latino
populations. Notable examples include:
The National Hispanic Medical Association (NHMA) – NHMA works to
improve health care for Hispanic communities by advocating for
policies that enhance medical education, research, and culturally
competent care.
UnidosUS – This nonprofit focuses on civil rights and advocacy, with
health programs aimed at educating and supporting Hispanic families
in navigating healthcare systems.

Health Literacy Media (HLM) – A nonprofit that helps healthcare
organizations create clear, accessible health communication
strategies.
Migrant Clinicians Network (MCN) – Provides health literacy resources
to migrant communities, focusing on reducing language and cultural
barriers in healthcare.

Local Community Health Centers and Free Clinics – Many community-
based health clinics offer language services and health literacy

programs tailored to non-English-speaking patients.
Our initiative is unique because it leverages university students as
health literacy navigators, making it both sustainable and scalable.
Unlike many existing programs that rely solely on professional
interpreters or advocacy organizations, our model empowers bilingual
students to provide direct community support. Additionally:
Interdisciplinary Approach: We incorporate expertise from public
health, political science, and social work, fostering holistic solutions.
Technology Integration: Our digital resource hub and mobile app
enhance accessibility for those unable to attend in-person assistance
sessions.
Policy Advocacy: We actively work with universities and healthcare
organizations to promote long-term policy changes that improve
access to health information.
To maximize our impact, we seek collaborations with:
Universities and Academic Institutions – Partnering with more
campuses will allow us to expand our reach and create new chapters
of student navigators.
Healthcare Providers and Clinics – Working with hospitals and
community clinics ensures our trained students can assist patients
effectively in real-world settings.
Nonprofits and Advocacy Groups – Collaborating with organizations
like UnidosUS and NHMA can help amplify our message and provide
additional training resources.
Technology Companies – Partnering with health tech startups or app
developers could enhance our digital platform, making information
more accessible to non-English speakers.
Government and Policy Makers – Engaging with public health agencies
and legislators can help institutionalize our initiative, in
uencing

broader health literacy policies.
Proposed social ventures should be unique, innovative and/or
leverage an existing idea or solution in a new way or a new
geography. Identify any current or anticipated organizational
partnerships. Please indicate the scope of the partnership and
any alternatives you are considering. Please include details on
how essential any specific partnership or organizations are to

your success.
Current and Anticipated Organizational Partnerships:
Camino Health Center (Primary Partner):
Camino Health is a bilingual, multicultural clinic that serves

underserved communities in Charlotte. As the foundational partner,
Camino Health will provide the platform for the delivery of the
program, including access to its medical professionals, educational
resources, and community network. This partnership is absolutely
essential for the success of the Health Literacy Program, as it ensures
the initiative is integrated into an established system that already
serves the target population. Without Camino Health’s infrastructure,
medical staff

, and local trust, the program could struggle to reach the

intended community.

UNC Charlotte Sustainable Development Club (Collaborator):
The UNC Charlotte Sustainable Development Club will support the
program through volunteer recruitment, fundraising, and awareness
campaigns. This partnership will help sustain the program by drawing
on the student base to provide volunteer educators, healthcare
professionals, and community engagement. Additionally, their
expertise in organizing fundraising events will help secure continued
nancial support. While the program could be launched without this
collaboration, their contribution in raising awareness and mobilizing
volunteers will significantly amplify the program's reach and longevity.

Local ESL and Community Organizations (Secondary Partners):
Partnering with local ESL programs and community organizations that
serve immigrant populations is essential for the widespread adoption
of the health literacy curriculum. These organizations already have the

trust of the community and established channels for reaching non-
English speakers. Their involvement will facilitate the integration of

health literacy into existing educational frameworks and ensure that
the content is culturally appropriate and accessible. These
partnerships are crucial for the program’s success, as they provide a
direct line to the target audience and ensure that the curriculum is
delivered through trusted community networks.

Healthcare Professionals and Faculty Members at Camino Health
(Advisory Partners):
Collaborating with healthcare professionals and faculty members at
Camino Health will ensure the program’s content is medically
accurate, up-to-date, and relevant. This partnership is essential for
making the health literacy curriculum credible and practical, providing
participants with the knowledge necessary to advocate for their own
health and navigate medical systems effectively. Without input from
healthcare professionals, the program would lack the real-world
medical expertise needed to ensure that participants gain actionable
knowledge.

Alternatives Considered:

Independent Health Literacy Experts: While partnering with health-
focused non-pro

ts or government organizations is one route, the
program could also seek collaboration with independent health
literacy experts who could provide specialized content tailored to the
community’s needs. However, this would require additional resources
and potentially lack the local community connection that the existing
partners o
er.

Online Delivery Platforms: Another alternative would be to consider
remote delivery through digital platforms, such as health literacy apps

or online courses. While this could help reach a broader audience, in-
person engagement through community centers, clinics, and trusted

local organizations is prioritized, as it helps build trust and provides
opportunities for real-time feedback and support.
Identify potential risks/challenges that will affect your social

venture's success.
While our social venture has the potential to make a significant impact
in improving health literacy, several risks and challenges must be
addressed to ensure its long-term success. These challenges range
from logistical and

financial concerns to institutional and community-
based obstacles.

1. Limited Student Participation and Retention
One of the core elements of our initiative is the involvement of
bilingual university students as health literacy navigators. However,
recruiting and retaining student volunteers may be di

cult due to
their academic workload, extracurricular commitments, and personal
responsibilities. High turnover rates among student volunteers could
disrupt continuity in service delivery and require ongoing recruitment
and training e

orts. Additionally, without incentives such as course
credit, stipends, or career development opportunities, participation
may decline over time.
2. Funding and Resource Constraints
Securing suficient and consistent funding is crucial for sustaining and
expanding the program. Costs associated with training, digital
resources, outreach, and operational expenses could become a
barrier if not adequately planned for. While initial funding may come
from university grants or nonproft partnerships, long-term
sustainability will require diversifying revenue sources, such as
corporate sponsorships, government grants, or donor contributions.
Without stable funding, program expansion and technological
improvements—such as the development of a mobile app—could be
delayed or compromised.
3. Institutional Barriers and Bureaucratic Challenges
Expanding our initiative within different university systems and
healthcare institutions may face bureaucratic resistance. Universities

Goals and Sustainability
and medical centers have existing policies, priorities, and
partnerships, which may slow down the approval and implementation
process. Some institutions may be hesitant to allow students to take
on advisory roles in health literacy without formal medical training.
Additionally, liability concerns and institutional regulations could
restrict the level of involvement students have in assisting patients.
Navigating these challenges will require building strong institutional
relationships and demonstrating the program’s benefits.

4. Community Trust and Engagement
Building trust with Spanish-speaking communities and other
underserved populations is critical but can take time. Many individuals
from these communities have had negative past experiences with
healthcare systems due to discrimination, misinformation, or
nancial
barriers. Gaining their trust will require culturally competent outreach,
consistent engagement, and strong partnerships with community
organizations. If the initiative fails to e
ffectively communicate its value
and maintain community involvement, participation may be limited,
reducing its impact.
5. Scaling and Adaptation Challenges
As the program expands to other universities and regions, it must be
adaptable to the specific needs of each community. While the primary

focus is on Spanish-speaking populations, different locations may
have unique challenges related to health literacy, language barriers, or
healthcare accessibility. Customizing the program for each setting
while maintaining consistency and quality will be a major challenge.
Additionally, expanding too quickly without suffcient infrastructure or

trained personnel could compromise the program’s effectiveness.

Conclusion
Addressing these challenges proactively will be key to the long-term
success of our social venture. By implementing strong recruitment
strategies, securing diverse funding sources, fostering institutional
partnerships, engaging communities authentically, and developing
scalable models, we can mitigate these risks and create a sustainable,
impactful initiative.

Goal 1
Equip immigrant communities with the essential health knowledge
through a structured ESL curriculum that integrates health and
education.
Goal 2

rmed?

Anticipated
Please explain (when expected, for what purpose, any other
relevant details)
The fundraising initiative is designed to engage student organizations
within UNC Charlotte, encouraging them to contribute what they can,
alongside their volunteer e

orts. These organizations have strong
connections with the immigrant and LatinX communities, as well as
public health clubs, pre-med clubs, and international relations e
orts.

By connecting with foreigners and o

ering ESL support, these groups
play a crucial role in outreach and community assistance. With the
large student population and the variety of clubs involved, it is
anticipated that this e

ort will raise $2,000 to help make the initiative

successful.
