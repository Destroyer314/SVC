Implementation Model

The venture operates through a structured three-tier model:
Training and Certification

University students undergo a rigorous training program that covers health literacy fundamentals, medical terminology, interpretation ethics, and effective communication skills. This certification ensures that students are well-equipped to assist individuals navigating the healthcare system.
Community Engagement and Direct Assistance

Certified students volunteer in hospitals, community health centers, and legal clinics to provide real-time interpretation, assist with filling out medical paperwork, and educate families on their healthcare rights and available resources.
Policy Advocacy and Expansion

A leadership team, composed of experienced members, works on expanding the program to other university campuses by forging partnerships with faculty, student organizations, and healthcare providers. They also advocate for institutional policies that improve healthcare accessibility for non-English-speaking populations.
